# C++ Asteroids
*1/2/23 - Now*

My first game created in C++ and [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/). Its is a worse version of the original [Asteroids game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game)) *(Created by the Atari Corperation)*. It includes all the features you would expect. Relistic space physics, hit detection, and loop over. This is also a project to try to learn git more.
